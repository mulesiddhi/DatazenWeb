      info:
        'Data science is the field of study that combines domain expertise, programming skills, and knowledge of mathematics and statistics to extract meaningful insights from data. Data science practitioners apply machine learning algorithms to numbers, text, images, video, audio, and more to produce artificial intelligence (AI) systems to perform tasks that ordinarily require human intelligence. In turn, these systems generate insights which analysts and business users can translate into tangible business value.',

        'Here, at Datazen it is our aim to help people learn and understand Data and tasks pertaining to it. This community is here to enhance the understanding, knowledge and experience of analysing data, taking it step by step, talking to people from around the world and understand from every perspective and every field. It is a place that gives students the platform to think out of the box and become as creativeas they can get with data and create something from the very scratch.'

      'Podcasts are a great way to immerse yourself in an industry, especially when it comes to data science. The field moves extremely quickly, and it can be difficult to keep up with all the new developments happening each week! Take advantage of those times in the day when your body is busy, but your mind is free: when you’re commuting to work, exercising at the gym, or cleaning up around the house. These are optimal times to engage your brain in learning something new and ensure you’re staying at the top of your field.'

      info:
        'There is already increasing automation in data science, and it is certainly not going to slow down. You can already program a machine based on multiple parameters to find the best possible business solution to a problem. In the past statisticians had to manually design their predictive models and readjust them over and over again. Growing amounts of data and ever more complex business problems make this very difficult without applying the concepts of data science. In this context, data science is here to stay for a very long time. ',
