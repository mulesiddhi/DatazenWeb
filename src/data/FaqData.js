        'There is already increasing automation in data science, and it is certainly not going to slow down. You can already program a machine based on multiple parameters to find the best possible business solution to a problem. In the past statisticians had to manually design their predictive models and readjust them over and over again. Growing amounts of data and ever more complex business problems make this very difficult without applying the concepts of data science. In this context, data science is here to stay for a very long time. ',
